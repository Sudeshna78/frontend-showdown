        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>TaxGPT’s “ask a question” feature uses <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>’s AI to return general information about India’s tax system, and is intended for a beginner audience. TaxGPT is <strong>not</strong> a tax calculator or a professional tax advisor: it can’t accurately calculate taxes owed for specific income amounts and it can’t reliably make specific recommendations for your tax situation.</p>
        <p>Avoid questions that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask for calculations about specific income amounts</li>
            <li>Describe complex tax scenarios (e.g., questions related to business income)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The more complex your question is, the less likely you are to receive a relevant response.</p>
        <p><strong>Ultimately, you are using TaxGPT at your own risk</strong>.</p>
        <p>Questions and responses are saved by <a href="https://typebot.io/">Typebot</a> and are used to improve the service, but they are anonymous and cannot be tied back to you in any way. Submissions that include personal information are deleted.</p>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>TaxGPT is an AI tax chatbot who helps Indians find free tax-filing options, and answers general questions about taxes. TaxGPT is under active development, so the question flow or the specific wording of answers may change over time.</p>
        <p><strong>TaxGPT is not sponsored by any company, it’s a 100% free service with no affiliations.</strong></p>
        <p>TaxGPT is also not a Government of India service. You can <a href="https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Pages/tax-services/ask-itd.aspx">chat with the Income Tax Department</a> on their official website.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Aniket-Haldar/taxgpt1">The source code for TaxGPT is on GitHub</a>, and I used <a href="https://typebot.io/">Typebot</a> for the chatbot interaction, which I found to be excellent.</p>

        <h4>Contact</h4>

        <p>I am kind of a one-person team over here, so there are likely some rough edges.</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <p>If you have a question that’s not on here, <span class="email--swap" data-email="YW5pa2V0QGVtYWlsLmNvbQ==" data-text="Get in touch">get in touch with “aniket [at] email [dot] com”</span> and I might add it.</p>

        <h4>Is TaxGPT a Government of India service?</h4>
        <p>Nope. If it was a government service, it would have <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/">a Government of India emblem at the top of the page</a>.</p>
        <p>You can visit the <a href="https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/">Income Tax Department’s website</a> for comprehensive personal tax filing information.</p>

        <h4>Is TaxGPT a scam?</h4>
        <p>Nope, not a scam. If TaxGPT was a scam, it would ask for your specific personal/financial details, like your home address or banking information. It just asks the user to provide general details that helps TaxGPT to provide precise results.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if this was a scam, it would definitely claim not to be a scam. (Not a scam though, to be clear.)</p>

        <h4>Can I file taxes through TaxGPT?</h4>
        <p>No. You can browse <a href="https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/">the Income Tax Department’s list of approved e-filing software</a> to find a suitable option.</p>

        <h4>What happens to my data?</h4>
        <p>TaxGPT needs general information about your state of residence and financial situation to make tailored recommendations about free tax-filing. Questions you type in and the responses to them are saved to improve the service.</p>

        <h4>Are you making money from this?</h4>
        <p>No, this is not a branded or sponsored product: TaxGPT is a completely free service. We built it, we are paying to host it, and we don’t make any money back in any way.</p>

        <h4>Why did you build this then?</h4>
        <p>Our team built TaxGPT for hackathon, as hackathons focus on creating solutions for real problems in a limited amount of time and so automating tax-related processes with AI felt to be an innovative and impactful idea.</p>
        <p>Doing taxes should be simple and straightforward, so TaxGPT tries to embody that.</p>

        <h4>Why do you recommend specific tax-filing software?</h4>
        <p>We recommend software that we believe is the best product for most people.</p>
        <p>Some other tax filing products offer a free tier but then try to undermine your confidence before you hit ‘submit’ — either suggesting you could get more money back with a paid version, etc.</p>
        <p>Government research has identified a “lack of confidence” as the main reason that Indians don’t file their own returns.</p>
        <p>We don’t need “voting professionals” to fill out ballots for us during elections; similarly, most Indians are capable of filing their own returns with the right tool and some encouragement.</p>
        <p>That’s why we highlight specific tax-filing products. It’s a well-designed, completely free tax-filing product without paid-for ‘premium’ features or trying to upsell you to an expert.</p>
        <p>If you believe another free tax-filing product without dark design patterns should be featured by TaxGPT, <a href="mailto:aniket.haldar05@gmail.com">Email get in touch</a></p>

        <h4>Is TaxGPT a dangerous experiment? What about the risk of wrong answers?</h4>
        <p>Many people are intimidated by tax filing and feel like they have to be an expert or pay an expert to engage with the subject of taxes.</p>
        <p>TaxGPT provides a simple user experience for people learning about taxes, in a way that is friendly and encouraging rather than being overly technical or undermining confidence. It is intended to make the subject more approachable.</p>
        <p>TaxGPT has its limitations, but it’s better than avoiding the subject entirely, and there’s no perverse incentive here. It’s something you can use from your home, you can use for free, and it offers guidance.</p>
        <p>In the end, TaxGPT gives recommendations on how to file your taxes for free, and it can answer general questions about tax filing in India, but it doesn’t assist you in completing your return.</p>

        <h4>“There’s a problem with the quiz”</h4>
        <p>Great, that’s just the feedback we are looking for. Please reach out and we will do our best to address it.</p>
        <p>Just note that the quiz tries to simplify the tax journey for people with a modest income and/or a simple tax scenario. It doesn’t try to cover every possibility — We want to simplify things for as many people as possible.</p>
